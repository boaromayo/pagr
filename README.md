### About

This repository stores a copy of the scripts for the 2006 [RPG Advocate](http://rpgmaker.wikia.com/wiki/RPG_Advocate) game, **Phylomortis: Avant Garde**.

The game scripts are coded in Ruby, and are used for the game engine RPG Maker XP.

### Overview

Phylomortis: Avant-Garde's plot is complex, with the dialogue's reading level equivalent to that of a graduate school paper.

More information about this game could be found at [the archived official site](https://web.archive.org/web/20080131101636/http://www.phylomortis.com:80/html/agstory.html).
